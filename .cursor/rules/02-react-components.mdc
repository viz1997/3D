- Use functional components with Hooks. Avoid class components.
- Component Naming: Use PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent`). File names should match component names (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`).
- Props:
    - Define prop types using TypeScript interfaces (e.g., `interface MyComponentProps { ... }`).
    - Destructure props in the function signature.
    - Use optional props with default values where appropriate.
    - Consider using prop validation for complex components.
- State Management:
    - Use `useState` for simple component-level state.
    - Use `useReducer` for more complex state logic within a component.
    - For global state, this project uses Zustand. Refer to the `stores/` directory for examples.
    - When using context, ensure it's properly optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Effects:
    - Use `useEffect` sparingly and properly manage dependencies.
    - Always clean up effects that create subscriptions or timers.
    - Consider using React 19's `use` hook for data fetching in client components.
- Performance Optimization:
    - Use `React.memo` for components that render often with the same props.
    - Use `useMemo` for expensive calculations and `useCallback` for functions passed to child components.
    - Avoid creating new objects or functions in render unless necessary.
    - Consider code-splitting with dynamic imports for larger components.
- Component Structure:
    - Common/reusable components in `components/`.
    - Route-specific components in their respective `app/` route directories.
    - UI components like buttons, inputs, etc. in `components/ui/`.
    - Complex components can have their own folder with multiple files (e.g., `components/MyComplexComponent/index.tsx`).
- Component Composition:
    - Prefer composition over props drilling.
    - Use children props, render props, or higher-order components for flexible components.
- Accessibility:
    - Ensure proper HTML semantics and ARIA attributes.
    - Make interactive elements keyboard accessible.
    - Maintain appropriate color contrast for text.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility (SRP).
