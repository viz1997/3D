      {
        "question": "What is an AI 3D model generator and how does it work?",
        "answer": "AI 3D model generator uses artificial intelligence to automatically create 3D models from text descriptions or images. AI 3D Model's AI analyzes your input (text prompt or photo) and reconstructs a complete 3D model with geometry, textures, and details. Unlike traditional 3D modeling that requires professional skills and hours of work, our AI generates production-ready models in just 3 minutes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is AI 3D Model really a free AI 3D model generator?",
        "answer": "Yes! AI 3D Model offers a free tier that lets you generate 3D models without any credit card required. Free users get access to our core features including text-to-3D, image-to-3D. You can export models in multiple formats (GLB, OBJ, STL) and try the platform risk-free."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need 3D modeling experience to use this AI generator?",
        "answer": "Absolutely not! AI 3D Model is designed for everyone - from complete beginners to professional 3D artists. No knowledge of Blender, Maya, or other 3D software is required. Simply upload an image or describe what you want in text, and our AI handles all the complex modeling automatically. It's the easiest way to create 3D models."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes AI 3D Model a leading AI 3D model generator compared to competitors?",
        "answer": "AI 3D Model leads the industry with 1536³ resolution (50% more detail than competitors like Meshy, Tripo, and 3D AI Studio which use 1024³). Independent benchmark tests show our models have 30% better edge definition. We offer fast generation speed (3 minutes for complex models), support both single and multi-image input, include white model generation for 3D printing, and provide smart low-poly optimization for games. Plus, we're one of the few truly free AI 3D generators with no hidden limits."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does it take to generate a 3D model with AI?",
        "answer": "If the model is simple, it can be generated in a few seconds; for more complex cases, it may take a few minutes depending on the complexity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What file formats can I export AI-generated 3D models to?",
        "answer": "AI 3D Model supports all major 3D formats: GLB (web-optimized), OBJ (universal), STL (3D printing), FBX (game engines), GLTF, USD, and more. You can import exported models directly into Blender, Maya, Unity, Unreal Engine, 3ds Max, Cinema 4D, and other professional 3D software. We also support format-specific optimizations for different use cases."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use AI-generated 3D models for commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Yes! All 3D models generated with AI 3D Model are yours to use commercially. You own full rights to use them in games, products, NFTs, client work, or any commercial application. Our free tier includes commercial usage rights. Check our terms for specific details, but we're built for professional and commercial use."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation?",
        "answer": "Text-to-3D creates models from written descriptions (e.g., 'a futuristic robot with glowing eyes'), ideal for creating new concepts from imagination. Image-to-3D reconstructs 3D models from photos, perfect for recreating real objects or converting 2D art into 3D. Both use AI but serve different creative needs. Image-to-3D typically produces more accurate results when you have reference photos, while text-to-3D offers unlimited creative freedom."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the AI 3D generator support multi-image input for better accuracy?",
        "answer": "Yes! While our AI can generate impressive 3D models from just a single image, you can upload 2-4 images from different angles for enhanced accuracy. Multi-image input significantly improves geometry quality and detail coverage, especially for complex objects. The AI automatically aligns and fuses perspectives to create superior 3D reconstructions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I generate low-poly models for game development?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! AI 3D Model includes smart low-poly optimization that automatically reduces polygon count while preserving visual quality. Our AI creates game-ready models optimized for real-time rendering in Unity, Unreal Engine, and web applications. You can specify target polygon count or let our AI determine optimal settings. Perfect for mobile games and performance-critical applications."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are white models and when should I use them?",
        "answer": "White models are untextured 3D meshes - pure geometry without colors or materials. They're ideal for: 1) 3D printing (where you don't need textures), 2) Manual texturing in Blender/Maya, 3) Base meshes for custom material work, 4) Clean product design references. Our white model generation includes automatic topology cleanup and ensures watertight geometry for reliable 3D printing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How accurate are AI-generated 3D models compared to manual modeling?",
        "answer": "For many use cases, AI-generated models rival manual modeling quality, especially with our 1536³ resolution. They excel at organic shapes, products, and characters. While expert human modelers can achieve slightly better results for highly specific requirements, our AI is 90-95% as accurate in a fraction of the time (3 minutes vs days). For rapid prototyping, game assets, and most commercial applications, the quality is production-ready."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I edit AI-generated 3D models after creation?",
        "answer": "Yes! All models can be exported to standard 3D formats and edited in Blender, Maya, or any 3D software. The AI-generated models have clean topology and proper UV mapping, making them easy to modify, retexture, or refine. Many users generate a base model with our AI, then add final touches manually - dramatically faster than modeling from scratch."
